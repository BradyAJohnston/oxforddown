# Some Final Notes on The OxThesis template
\minitoc <!-- this will include a mini table of contents-->

## Beginning chapters with quotes
The OxThesis LaTeX template lets you add some wittiness to you thesis by including a block of type `savequote` at the beginning of chapters. With R Markdown, use the syntax ```` ```{block type='savequote'} ````.^[For more on custom block types, see the relevant section in [_Authoring Books with R Markdown_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/custom-blocks.html).]
You will probably also want to add the chunk option `include=knitr::opts_knit$get('rmarkdown.pandoc.to') == 'latex'` so that quotes are only included in PDF output.

Add the reference for the quote with the chunk option `quote_author="my author name"`. 
It's not possible to use markdown syntax inside chunk options, so if you want to e.g. italicise a book name in the reference use a 'text reference': Create a named piece of text with '(ref:label-name) My text', then point to this in the chunk option with `quote_author='(ref:label-name)'`.


## Highlighting of corrections
For when it comes time to do corrections, you may want to highlight corrections you have made when you submit a post-viva, corrected copy to your examiners so they can quickly verify you've completed the task. You can do so like this:

First, you may highlight **short, inline corrections** by wrapping them in a `<span>` tag with the class 'correction'. 
In other words, `<span class="correction">do like this</span>`, which in <span class="correction">the output will be highlighted in blue</span>.
To stop inline corrections from being highlighted in PDF output, comment out `pandoc_args: ["--lua-filter=scripts_and_filters/correction_filter.lua"]` in the YAML header. 
To stop corrections being highlighed in gitbook output, comment out the styling for `.correction` in **style.css**.

Second, for entire blocks of added or changed material, you can put it in a block of type `correction`.^[In the **.tex** file for PDF output, this will put the content between `\begin{correction}` and `\end{correction}`; in gitbook output it will be put between `<div class="correction">` and `</div>`.]
Like so:

```{block type='correction'}
For larger chunks, like this paragraph or indeed entire figures, you can use the `correction` block type. This environment **highlights paragraph-sized and larger blocks** with the same blue colour.
```

To stop blocks of corrections from being highlighted in PDF output, set `corrections: false` under `params` in the YAML header, and comment out the styling for the class `.correction` in **style.css**.^[I will streamline this eventually so that `corrections: true/false` in the YAML header is the only thing one will need to tweak to adjust whether or not corrections will be highlighted.]

## Diving in to the OxThesis LaTeX template
For LaTeX minded people, you can read through **templates/template.tex** to see which additional customisation options are available as well as **templates/ociamthesis.cls** which supplies the base class.
For example, **template.tex** provides a separate option for master's degree submissions, which changes identifying information to candidate number and includes a word count. 
At the time of writing, you must set this directly in **template.tex** rather than from the YAML header in **index.Rmd**.

## Collaborative writing
Best practices for collaboration and change tracking when using R Markdown are still an open question. In the blog post [**One year to dissertate**](https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2018/09/14/one-year-to-dissertate/) by Lucy D'Agostino, which I highly recommend, the author notes that she knits .Rmd files to a `word_document`, then uses the `googledrive` R package to send this to Google Drive for comments / revisions from co-authors, then incorporates Google Drive suggestions *by hand* into the .Rmd source files. 
This is a bit clunky, and there are ongoing discussions among the _R Markdown_ developers about what the best way is to handle collaborative writing (see [issue #1463](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1463) on GitHub, where [CriticMarkup](http://criticmarkup.com) is among the suggestions).

For now, this is an open question in the community of R Markdown users. 
I often knit to a format that can easily be imported to Google Docs for comments, then go over suggested revisions and manually incorporate them back in to the .Rmd source files. 
For articles, I sometimes upload a near-final draft to [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), then collaboratively make final edits to the \LaTeX\ file there. 
I suspect some great solution will be developed in the not-to-distant future, probably by the RStudio team.
