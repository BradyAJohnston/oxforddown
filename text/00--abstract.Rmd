This *R Markdown* template is for writing an Oxford University thesis. The template is built from scratch using the Yihui Xie's `bookdown` package, but with heavy reuse of content from Chester Ismay's `thesisdown` package, along with the `OxThesis` \LaTeX\ template in the form adapted by John McManigle.

This template's sample content mostly consists of illustrations (mostly taken from `thesisdown`) of how to do the various things you need to write a thesis in R Markdown.

Congratulations for taking a step further into the lands of open, reproducible science, by writing your thesis using a tool that allows you to transparently include tables and dynamically generated plots directly from the underlying data. Hip hooray for open science!
