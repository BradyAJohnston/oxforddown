# You can be lazy and just let bookdown search for the .Rmd files to merge into your thesis.
# For this to work, make sure to start any acknowledgements and/or abstract Rmd files with 
# an underscore, e.g. _abstract.Rmd. 
# Otherwise bookdown will start to merge the abstract in to the body text which almost 
# certainly isn't what you want

# If you specify a sub directory with rmd_subdir, then bookdown will search through this
# folder too
rmd_subdir: ["front-and-back-matter"]

# Alternatively, you can comment out rmd_subdir and specify manually what files to include with rmd_files
#rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "text/01-rmd-basics.Rmd", "text/02-math-sci.Rmd", "text/03-table-graphics-refs.Rmd", "text/04-oxthesis.Rmd", "text/05-conclusion.Rmd", "text/06-appendices.Rmd", "text/99-references.Rmd"]

# You can provide a link here if you want people to be able to suggest and submit changes
# to the source .Rmd files on your github repo, cf. https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/html.html
