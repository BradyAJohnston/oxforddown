# Oxforddown

A template for writing an Oxford University thesis in R Markdown.

The template uses the [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) R package together with the [OxThesis LaTeX template](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis), plus lots and lots of inspiration and sample content from [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown).

Note that this project is very much still work in progress.
