# Troubleshooting

This chapter describes common errors you may run into, and how to fix them.

## Error: Failed to build the bibliography via biber
This can happen if you've had a failed build, perhaps in relation to RStudio shutting down abruptly.

Things to try:
- type `make clean-knits` in the terminal tab, then try recompiling
- restart your computer (yes, really - this solved the problem for me, when I got this error after RStudio was abruptly shut down in the middle of a PDF build)
- check your LaTeX installation
