<!-- NOTE ON COMPILING YOUR THESIS: 
- if you want to compile the whole thesis, click 'Build Book' over on the Build tab; if you just click 'knit' on Index.Rmd, it may just put "Placeholder" as text in individual chapters instead of compiling all the conten¨¨
- compiling your thesis will leave a lot of files in your working directory, mostly for the mini tables of content - you can run the command 'file.remove(list.files(pattern = ".log$|.maf$|.mtc"))' in the R console to remove them in one go
 -->


```{r create_chunk_options, include=FALSE}
source('scripts/create_chunk_options.R')
```
<!-- NOTE ON CREATING NEW CHUNK OPTIONS: 
- include the create_chunk_options chunk above at the top of your index.Rmd file
- this adds code to create additional chunk options you need (e.g. for adding author references to the quotes you see at the top of chapter 1 and 4 with r markdown rather than latex syntax)
- if you need to create additional chunk options for your own purposes, I recommend you do it in the file scripts/create_chunk_options.R to avoid clutter in index.Rmd

```{r package_check, include=FALSE}
# List of packages required
pkg <- c("devtools", "bookdown")
# Check if packages are not installed and assign the
# names of the packages not installed to the variable new.pkg
new.pkg <- pkg[!(pkg %in% installed.packages())]
# If there are any packages in the list that aren't installed,
# install them
if (length(new.pkg))
  install.packages(new.pkg, repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ Oxford University thesis template. The sample content is adapted from [`thesisdown`](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) and the formatting of PDF output is adapted from the [OxThesis \LaTeX\ template](https://github.com/mcmanigle/OxThesis). Hopefully writing your thesis in R Markdown will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX or LaTeX before. More importantly, using _R Markdown_ allows you to embed chunks of code directly into your thesis, and generate plots and tables directly from their underlying data, avoiding copy-paste steps. Hopefully, this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of LaTeX in combination with _Markdown_ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may never have had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities.  After working with _Markdown_ and **R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

## Why use it?
_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R**, **Python** or other languages, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for results of code output to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later, focusing on **R**. If you are more into **Python** or something else, you can still use _R Markdown_ - see ['Other language engines'](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html) in Yihui Xie's [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html).

<!-- 
Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of benefits!
-->

## Who should use it?
Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about reproducibility in research should use _R Markdown_. If you are working in 'softer' fields, the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should still make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.
